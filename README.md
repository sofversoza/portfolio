<sup>VERSION 1  â€”  JULY 2022 Â©</sup>

## HELLO, WELCOME TO MY FIRST PORTFOLIO SITE! ðŸª… ðŸª… ðŸª…
I'm filled with excitement as I'm typing this. It's finally finished and I'm so proud of how it turned out! 
This is by far the biggest project I've ever worked on and the one I'm most proud of. The whole process of building and designing my personal site
was something I've been anticipating since boot camp days. Full creative freedom is the most enjoyable aspect of building web applications for me, and I 
definitely took advantage of that here. I wanted my Portfolio to portray my aesthetics and what I'm interested in the real world. 
And I can proudly say that I've met my main and only goal for this project and I couldn't be happier with how it came out! â˜» â˜ºï¸Ž 

ðŸ—£ *This project will definitely always be a work in progress. As I acquire new skills & as my interests grow &/or change â€” I'll be updating 
anything that doesn't feel true to me and represent me as a person & as a designer.*
